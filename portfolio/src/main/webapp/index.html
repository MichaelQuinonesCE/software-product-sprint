       <h1 style = "color:darkgray"> A little about me!</h1>
            <p style = "color:lightgray">Hello, my name is Michael Quinones!<p>
            <p style = "color:lightgray">   I am currently finishing my sophomore year under the science in computer engineering major. 
            Computer science is a really interesting field to me because I have all of the creative possibilities one can imagine in order to construct software that can benefit others. 
            Precisely, benefiting others is what most satisfies me because it gives me the opportunity to help others be successful at what they do. 
            Now that our culture and society are rapidly being modernized through technology, software development proves to be a great tool to serve others.</p> 
            <p style = "color:lightgray">   Also, working in groups is something that I profoundly enjoy. 
            Working collectively puts me in the position not only to benefit others, but also to learn from others. 
            There's nothing more gratifying than going through the thorough process of working in groups in order to accomplish complex tasks. 
            After all is done, relationships were built in the process, and experience was gained. 
            Stated this, I believe that the relationships and experience, a lot of hard work can be done and others can be benefited.   </p>
